### The tool will scan defined blockchains for events that are meant for it. It will pin CIDs to the IPFS nods that are under its management, additionally it will index those events storing them in the database to provide statistics.  

### This tool is currently under development, soon an Anspar nApp will be available to provide GUI for RPC commands.
